7,"my primary intention was to chop beetroot when i bought this..blades didn’t cut through even half inch cube pieces,had to make it even smaller and also blades will turn only if we put 3-4 such pieces (approximately 1/4 inch cube pieces), though i bought the 900ml one, it could process only that much pieces at a time and had to open and add pieces often..it might work well with other veggies like onions but haven’t tried yetREAD MORE",3

10,"Small god .. pretty usable for a small kitchen.But you could have really provide an additional set of blades ( then nobody's gonna buy this twice ha ha).

224,"Best in the market.. Go for 0.9L (900ml). Vegetables can be finely chopped especially onions, tomatoes, potatoes, green Chillies etc.. Tomatoes can be made into paste, just add half a glass of water while chopping. The 900ml one comes with five blades. Be careful while cleaning the blades, blades are very sharp, Don't touch the blades while cleaning, just put the blades under tap running water to clean. Butterfly is a premium brand for kitchen tools and non-stick utensils.READ MORE",5

Whatever be the quantity, it will chop it into tiny bits. After going through all the choppers available online I finally decided to go for butterfly's and it was the right choice. It looks sleek and premium and does its job well. Only thing to keep in mind is that you have to be careful while handling the blades cause they are super sharp.READ MORE",5

5565,The product is excellent. You're getting exactly what you're expecting. Easy to chop any vegetables. I personally found it very useful and easy to use. I don't know about the durability of the product and how long the blades will remain sharp. The lid is easily removable. The blade is also removable and that makes it easy to clean.This is an absolute value for money product.Design 4/5Blade 5/5Looks 4/5Quality 5/5READ MORE,5

5675,Good vegetable chopper.AdvantagesYou can chop onion without tears.You can chop vegetables faster.You can clean it easily Disadvantages The blade is sharp and can cause injury. Handle with care.Large onion and big carrot pieces get stuck on the blades and jam the unitSuggestionThe torque on the center rotating shift has to be increased by redesigning the mechanism to make it more comfortable.READ MORE,5
